ðŸ’œ This project was created by a group of Hyper Island School students. The aim is to use react to deepen your knowledge.
We used the Vite tool to develop it. We also used the Tailwind css framework. 

The name of the application is Hinder (mix between Hyper Island & Tinder ).
The aim of this mini social media application is to connect students using a like/dislike system.
You can log in, add a username and then, once you're logged in, you'll have access to a carousel with photos of the school's students you can then like/dislike.
When two likes are mutual, you'll have a match! You can view all your matches on another page. 

Once the experience is over, you can log out.
